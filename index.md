The following is a workshop and open educational resource for using the People's Guide, a public history template that is a developing collaboration between the University of Idaho Library's Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning and the Department of History. The workshop will walk you through the process of determining what type of essay might work best for your assignment, how to assemble all of the materials you will need for the project and how to submit those items and your written material. 

> In addition to developing your historical knowledge, this exercise will provide an introduction to digital scholarship that will expand your skill set.
