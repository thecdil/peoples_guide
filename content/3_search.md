## Major Search Engines

<br>

Why search in multiple areas for media when the major search engines are so intuitive and easy to use? While our digital collections are google searchable at the [University of Idaho](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22An+elephant+skull+on+display%22&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwi87fjE5r-DAxUtCTQIHZ5UCfMQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=%22An+elephant+skull+on+display%22&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQA1CAHlj0JWCKKGgAcAB4AIABNIgBlAGSAQEzmAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=nJSUZbyvE62S0PEPnqmlmA8&bih=957&biw=1920&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS1072US1072){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, the majority of digital archives for universities, cultural institutions and libraries are not. This comes from the push and pull of archives wanting to make things available for researchers but not so much for bots engaging in web scraping. 

{% include figure.html img="RSS-082.gif" alt="Table with large plates of odd, antiquated dishes from the 1950s" caption="Fort Lewis buffet featuring pickles, aspic desserts, gourds and cake,RSS-127, Richards Studio Photographic Slides (Collection 2.1.1), Northwest Room at Tacoma Public Library, " width="75%" %}

The [Tacoma Public Library Northwest Room](https://www.tacomalibrary.org/northwestroom/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  is an example of this type of database asset management platform. If I wanted to find [this specific photo in their archive](https://northwestroom.tacomalibrary.org/index.php/rss-082){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} , searching [Jello desserts in 1950's Tacoma](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=595201269&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS1072US1072&sxsrf=AM9HkKk1HLdRR7CjRHlpLqlius1fvvlo-A:1704236861105&q=jello+desserts+in+1950%27s+Tacoma&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiIjuCF6b-DAxXlMjQIHRCfCFMQ0pQJegQIDhAB&biw=1920&bih=957&dpr=1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} , Google's algorithms are ineffective with these keywords. Even if I implement Boolean quotes around the [exact description](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=595201269&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS1072US1072&hl=en&sxsrf=AM9HkKnp4nQ7WaK0fSyNz1L7KsUk1nSpBA:1704236951466&q=%22Fort+Lewis+buffet+featuring+pickles,+aspic+desserts,+gourds+and+cake.%22&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjjs-uw6b-DAxX0AjQIHVqLBm8Q0pQJegQIDhAB&biw=1920&bih=957&dpr=1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} , we don't have access to the image through Google (although we are pointed to the [general collection in the text search](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Fort+Lewis+buffet+featuring+pickles%2C+aspic+desserts%2C+gourds+and+cake.%22&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS1072US1072&oq=%22Fort+Lewis+buffet+featuring+pickles%2C+aspic+desserts%2C+gourds+and+cake.%22&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg70gEIMjQ0NmowajSoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} .)

## Search Resources

<br>

The following module is a list of resources you can use to find images, audio and video material, working broadly and then drilling down into smaller, more detailed resources. Using the filter on the right hand side of the following module, you can pinpoint repositories that will be most helpful for you. These include filtering by format (`images, audio and video`) as well as by repository type, which include:

- `Broad`: Major search engines
- `Consortiums`: Essentially collections of collections
- `Large Archival Institutions`
- `International Consortiums`: Resources outside of the United States
- `Newspapers`: All accessible to University of Idaho students and faculty
- `Books and Journals`: An underutilized resource for finding illustrations and engravings of figures before 1900

__Where available, copyright search features have already been configured.__

## Regional Archive Examples

<br>

**In addition to these resources,** there are thousands of smaller digital collections that may be helpful resources for your search. See examples below of regional digital collections that you may be able to find depending on where your subject is located

- `Universities and Higher Education Archives,` like the [University of Idaho Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
- `State Government Archives,` like the [Washington State Digital Archives](https://digitalarchives.wa.gov/Search#2){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
- `Infrastructural Archives,` like the [Washington State Department of Transportation Digital Collections](https://cdm16977.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/search/searchterm/moscow%20idaho){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
- `Municipal Archives,`like the [Seattle Municipal Archives Digital Collections](https://archives.seattle.gov/digital-collections/index.php/MultiSearch/Index?search=moscow){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
- `Cultural and Community Archives,` such as [Washington Rural Heritage](https://www.washingtonruralheritage.org/digital/search/searchterm/moscow%20idaho){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
- `Historical Society Archives` like the [Washington State Historical Society](https://www.washingtonhistory.org/research/collections-search/?search_term=moscow+idaho){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
- `Public Library Archives,` like the [Tacoma Public Library Northwest Room](https://northwestroom.tacomalibrary.org/index.php/informationobject/browse?topLod=0&sort=relevance&query=moscow+idaho&repos=19266){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 

<br>

## Physical Resources

<br>

**In addition to private study and conference rooms you are welcome to reserve for individual and group study**, the library also maintains unique technical resources to help enrich your work. This includes **[The Studio](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/studio/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**, where you can use audio/visual production equipment to record, edit and digitize audio and video projects. The Studio was recently updated summer 2025 with a new podcasting space for students to record longform interviews as well as a "Whisper Room" enclosure for recording dialogue in a sound designed space.A full list of resources can be found at this [link in the presentation site](https://vandalsuidaho-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/hanwendong_uidaho_edu/EZe6R_SuDnZCm2xK7vepWwsBbKSxVMyrv34ANJF66OFxSw?e=VHFEqq){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

{% include gallery-figure.html img="cals_intro_01.jpg" alt="Photograph of a work station in the U of I Library Reading Room with a laptop and archival box visible" caption="U of I Library Reading Room with Special Collection Material. Photograph by Brian Tibayan" width="100%" %}

We also maintain an extensive **[academic archive](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}** at the U of I library that can be a valuable resource for primary documents to help make your work stronger and add historic contrast. You can search the archive at a collection (not item) level through this [Archives West portal](https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/search.php?r=idu&q=){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and, if you find something of interest, contact our excellent archivists at libspec@uidaho.edu with the details, who can schedule you a time to review the materials in person at the first floor meeting room.

## Keyword and Naming Strategies

<br>

__On a past project__, I was trying to find a photo of a [Filipino cannery worker](https://maritimewa.org/story/through-a-filipino-lens-washington-state-cannery-workers-in-alaska/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} that traveled between San Francisco and Alaska in the 1920s and 30s. I found that `Salvador Caballero` was listed in newspapers, union periodicals and archival records alternately as `S. Caballero, Sal Caballero and Salvatore Caballero`. 

Older documents will often add a middle initial to a name and sometimes abbreviate first names in ways we don't often see anymore. For example, Geo. for George, Abig. for Abigail and Chas. for Charles, pop up frequently in historic newspapers and books. This [Wiktionary list](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Abbreviations_for_English_given_names){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} of English name abbreviations is a handy reference if you encounter this. 


The University of Idaho's [Taylor Wilderness Research Station](https://www.uidaho.edu/cnr/taylor-wilderness-research-station){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was previously Taylor Ranch. The town of [Tensed, ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensed,_Idaho){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was originally named De Smet after a Belgian missionary, reversed and misspelled at the post office. As of 2022, the US Department of Interior renamed [71 natural areas](https://idahocapitalsun.com/briefs/interior-department-votes-to-rename-geographic-places-in-idaho-that-included-ethnic-slur-for-indigenous-women/#:~:text=In%20Idaho%2C%20the%20changes%20included,Naokwaide%20and%20Newe%20Waippe%20Naokwaide.){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} around Idaho that previously had derogatory names. 

__The names of buildings, cities and natural resources can shift colloquially over time or over night__. If you find a strange gaps in search results, try zooming out and searching more encyclopedic sources like Wikipedia or [Geonames](https://www.geonames.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to check for semantic shifts.

## Boolean Operators

<br>

If your topic is **Moscow, Idaho vs. Spokane, Washington Mining Industries**, you can use `"Moscow, Idaho" OR "Spokane, Washington" AND consumption` as possible keyword search terms. The quotations and capitalized AND/OR in this search are examples of what are called _boolean operators_, a "logical combinatorial system that represents symbolic relationships between entities" per Merriam-Webster. More simply, it's a way to refine what you are and are not looking for in a single search. 

 The most basic elements are using [AND](https://dp.la/search?q=Moscow+AND+Idaho&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [OR](https://dp.la/search?q=Moscow+OR+Idaho&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [NOT](https://dp.la/search?q=Moscow+NOT+Idaho&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} between keywords or putting [quotes](https://dp.la/search?q=%22Moscow%2C+Idaho%22&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} around your phrases to use an exact phrase and [parenthesis](https://dp.la/search?q=%28Moscow%2C+Idaho%29+AND+%28flour%29&type=%22image%22){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} when using multiple operators in the same line. Helpful Google (and Google Scholar) operators include [site:](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lib.uidaho.edu+%22video%22&sca_esv=f7f0ca8bbe6f40fd&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS1072US1072&sxsrf=ACQVn083DunaahW_XbbIVrxR8Z0y9uTihQ%3A1710957328889&ei=ECP7ZcTsNb6y0PEP4LuryAQ&oq=site%3A&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiBXNpdGU6KgIIADIEECMYJzIEEAAYAzITEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQYCjIEEAAYAzIQEAAYgAQYFBiHAhixAxiDATIEEAAYAzIEEAAYAzIQEC4YgAQYigUYQxjHARivATILEC4YgAQYxwEYrwEyBRAAGIAESORQUPMMWPw3cAJ4AZABAJgBaqABkQSqAQM1LjK4AQHIAQD4AQGYAgagAt0CwgIKEAAYRxjWBBiwA8ICBxAjGLACGCfCAgoQIRgKGKABGMMEmAMAiAYBkAYIkgcDNS4xoAeKHQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (as well as -site) to include or exclude results from specific sites and [AROUND(#)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Moscow%2C+Idaho+AND+flour+AROUND+%284%29&sca_esv=f7f0ca8bbe6f40fd&rlz=1C1GCEU_enUS1072US1072&sxsrf=ACQVn0-pXlPjzFPEGk9pSd4FMUGD3j1v-g%3A1710957636133&ei=RCT7ZbPiB8GK0PEPz8aF6Ao&ved=0ahUKEwizlILxtYOFAxVBBTQIHU9jAa0Q4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=Moscow%2C+Idaho+AND+flour+AROUND+%284%29&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiIk1vc2NvdywgSWRhaG8gQU5EIGZsb3VyIEFST1VORCAoNCkyCBAhGKABGMMEMggQIRigARjDBDIIECEYoAEYwwRIkg1Q8gZYkQdwAXgBkAEAmAF_oAHvAaoBAzAuMrgBA8gBAPgBAZgCAqACecICChAAGEcY1gQYsAOYAwCIBgGQBgiSBwMxLjGgB7sG&sclient=gws-wiz-serp){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to produce results where your two keywords on either side are within a certain number of words with each other.
