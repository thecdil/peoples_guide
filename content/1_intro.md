My name is Andrew Weymouth and I am an [assistant professor with the University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html) and [the digital initiatives librarian for the Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies department](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). I focus on using static web technology to curate the institution’s special collections and partner with faculty and students to create custom fellowship projects. I also develop digital tools and workflows to enhance transcription, tagging, and image processing to make the university’s media, text, and visual resources more discoverable for researchers.

## Digital Scholarship

<br>

To begin, _digital scholarship_ (somewhat interchangeable with “digital humanities”) refers to academic work that leverages digital tools, methods, and platforms to conduct research, present findings, and engage with both scholarly and public audiences. It encompasses the use of digital technologies to enhance traditional research practices and introduces new ways of creating, sharing, and analyzing knowledge.

As we will explore today, digital scholarship consists of selecting only certain parts of the data you have assembled and representing that data in different ways in order to draw out new insights and connections, help people understand new dimensions of your findings during the presentation stage and also create accessible material online, so that others can explore and learn more about your work.

### Examples of Digital Scholarship

- [CDIL](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/)
    - [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) (digitized or born digital library open access collections)
    - [CDIL Projects](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/projects/) (scholarship projects with collaborators)
    - [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) (open source framework for creating digital collection and exhibit websites, developed at CDIL, powers everything!)

#### Student Digital Scholarship Projects

- [HJCCC](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/hjccc/) (archeology dissertation typology to browseable website)
- [Voices of Gay Rodeo](https://www.voicesofgayrodeo.com/) (faculty research, grows to involve students. a resource that makes the research more accessible than just the book)
- [Human and Ecological Change in Big Creek](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/big-creek-rephotography/) (rephotography project)
- [Moscow High School Archaeology](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/ipa-mhs/) (public archaeology project, see StoryMaps)
- [Fire Lines](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/fire-lines/) (essay on top of a curated research collection)
- [Keeping Watch](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/keeping-watch/) (multi-modal geospatial essay)


### Data and Spreadsheets

- Thinking about (humanities/history) data. 
- How does structured data becomes websites? 
- How does metadata impact discovery, useability, and context?

Example guide-like project: 

- [Latah County Historic Places](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahsites/)
    - [Physical map](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahsites/items/latahsites0093.html)
    - Current photographs
    - Historic photographs
    - Parse into data
    - Represent as spreadsheet (metadata, structured data)

## People's Guide Template

<br>

The digital scholarship project I'll be talking about today is the People's Guide template, which you will be contributing to. This template is a work in progress that was first developed by my colleague Evan Williamson for Dr. Kreikemeier's course named the [People's Guide to the Inland Pacific Northwest](https://thecdil.github.io/peoples-ipnw/), and is an iteration on the same template that we use for all of our [digital collections at the university](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/). 

The main difference is that the digital collection templates are more database-oriented, whereas the one you will be using is more essay-oriented. Both contain media, such as images, PDF files, audio or video, as well as _metadata_, or information about that media, including it's title, creator, description, source, etc. Moving forward, I'll refer to all media types as items, so you know these all go under the same umbrella.

<br>

## Why?

<br>

Rather than having a bunch of individual essays, the advantage to this approach is that you can see all of your research together and create new context by visualizing the ways that your findings overlap. Even though you will all be creating individual essays, you will be able to see these connections by using common fields of metadata and descriptions, which we will explain in the next section.

While your particular course may refer to the different types of essays that you can submit as multi-modal, narrative or video, these all basically function the same way within the template:

- First, you will create a Google Doc containing the content of your essay, following a set of basic conventions.
- Second, if you are using images or other items in your essay, you will create a Google Sheet that lists and describes each of the items you want to include with your essay, along with their associated metadata. 
- Third, you will submit a Google Form providing metadata about your essay topic and the share links to your Document and Sheet. The metadata represents the standardized fields we will all use to describe our submissions. They allow users to discover, browse, and understand the essays. The form will ask information such as: `title, description, time_period, location, province, latitude, longitude, status, gender, age, occupation, family_status, theme`.

> In the following section, we will walk through some resources you can use to locate items that will add context to your essay, understanding the copyright status of those items, search strategies and library resources if you are interested in creating a longform audio or video essay.
