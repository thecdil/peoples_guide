My name is Andrew Weymouth and I am an [assistant professor with the University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html) and [the digital initiatives librarian for the Digital Scholarship and Open Strategies department](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). I focus on using static web technology to curate the institution’s special collections and partner with faculty and students to create custom fellowship projects. I also develop digital tools and workflows to enhance transcription, tagging, and image processing to make the university’s media, text, and visual resources more discoverable for researchers.

## Digital Scholarship

<br>

To begin, _digital scholarship_ (interchangeable with “digital humanities”) refers to academic work that leverages digital tools, methods, and platforms to conduct research, present findings, and engage with both scholarly and public audiences. It encompasses the use of digital technologies to enhance traditional research practices and introduces new ways of creating, sharing, and analyzing knowledge.

As we will explore today, digital scholarship consists of selecting only certain parts of the data you have assembled and representing that data in different ways in order to draw out new insights and connections, help people understand new dimensions of your findings during the presentation stage and also create accessible material online, so potential collaborators can learn more about your work.

<br>

## People's Guide Template

<br>

The digital scholarship project I'll be talking about today is the People's Guide template, which you will be contributing to. This template is a work in progress that was first developed by my colleague Evan Williamson for Dr. Kreikemeier's course named the [People's Guide to the Inland Pacific Northwest](https://thecdil.github.io/peoples-ipnw/), and is an iteration on the same template that we use for all of our [digital collections at the university](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/). 

The main difference is that the digital collection templates are more database-oriented, whereas the one you will be using is more essay-oriented. Both contain media, such as images, PDF files, audio or video, as well as _metadata_, or information about that media, including it's title, creator, description, source, etc. Moving forward, I'll refer to all media types as items, so you know these all go under the same umbrella.

<br>

## Why?

<br>

Rather than having a bunch of individual essays, the advantage to this approach is that you can see all of your research together and create new context by visualizing the ways that your findings overlap. Even though you will all be creating individual essays, you will be able to see these connections by using common fields of metadata and descriptions, which we will explain in the next section.

While your particular course may refer to the different types of essays that you can submit as multi-modal, narrative or video, these all basically function the same way within the template:

- First, you will submit a Google Doc that has all of the text laid out the way you would like it, indicating where you want to add your items, headers, line breaks, etc.
- Second, you will submit a Google Sheet template containing all of the items you want to include in your essay, along with their associated metadata.

> In the following section, we will walk through some resources you can use to locate items that will add context to your essay, understanding the copyright status of those items, search strategies and library resources if you are interested in creating a longform audio or video essay.
