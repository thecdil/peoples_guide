## Creative Commons

<br>

While our [U of I Library Copyright Guide](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/copyright/guide.html) and the [Cornell Libguide](https://guides.library.cornell.edu/copyright/publicdomain){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  are excellent, thorough resources, my goal here is to provide an abridged version of issues you will most likely to encounter sourcing copyright free media to compliment your research. 

First off, items can be made available by any one of the [six creative commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} . This [License Chooser](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  module created by the Creative Commons is helpful in understanding why people choose the different variations you'll encounter during research. 

<br>

## Public Domain

<br>

Things become quite complicated regarding media that is not in public domain, so let's begin with media that <red>is in the public domain</red>. These include:
* Any item published **before** _{{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 95 }}_ regardless of copyright status (_{{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 100 }}_ for sound recordings)
* Any item published without a copyright notice between _{{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 95 }}_-_1977_
* Any item published without a copyright notice and subsequent registration within 5 years of expiration from _1978-1989_
* Any item published with notice but copyright was not renewed, _{{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 95 }}_-_1963_
* Any item prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person's official duties
* _For the most part_, any item published outside the United States before _1978_

If you are interested in using elements from historic newspapers, please reference [this page from another one of my guides to determine if it is available to use](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/source_cr_free/content/basics/start.html).

<br>

## Fair Use

<br>

But does any of this matter when you can claim you are using copyright protected material in _fair use_? According to the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/), fair use is the "legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances." These special circumstances include the “purpose and character of the use” particularly when using for non-profit and/or educational purposes. 

That said, arguing the case that you are implementing an item in fair use in court expensive and time consuming. In my work, I've never needed to use a copyright protected image under fair use, aside from a handful of times it was requested directly by the company administration, who understood the liabilities in doing so. 

<br>

## Attribution

<br>

Even though [only some](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} Creative Common licenses require attribution, it will be helpful to you as a researcher to give full credits to all of your work. Providing a **title, author, source** (including archival catalog number if applicable) and **license** of the work will ultimately improve your records, dissuade infringement claims and help readers find the media sources independently if they are interested. 

<br>

## Version Copyright

<br>

Lastly, you may encounter images which should be in public domain but are claimed by stock photography giants such as Getty Images or AP News to be under their copyright. This is because these companies have copyright over a **particular print, version or photograph** of the public domain work.

{% include figure.html img="mona_lisa.jpg" alt="Photograph of the Mona Lisa" caption="Mona Lisa, photograph by Josh Hallett, Paris, July 2009, under CC BY-SA 2.0 license" width="75%" %}

One example is the _Mona Lisa_, which is public domain because Leonardo da Vinci died more than 70 years ago. Getty would like to sell you [this photograph](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/mona-lisa-also-called-la-gioconda-or-la-joconde-c1503-1506-news-photo/113493446?adppopup=true){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  of the painting for $500, because they have registered copyright on __that print__, not the actual painting.

You can also choose to use [the above photograph](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mona_Lisa_-_the_Louvre.jpg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  for free, because the person who took it also made it publicly available. This is another place where good record keeping and proper attribution will pay off. As long as you can point to a copyright free version you sourced the media from, you are protected from liability. 

<br>

### Reverse Image Searching

<br>

But what if you have an image with no data and you need to determine the copyright status of the object? This is a perfect job for reverse image searching, which has greatly increased in accuracy due to rapid developments in machine learning. While Google, Bing and Yandex all have reverse image searching tools in their browser, I prefer [TinEye](https://tineye.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for it's simple interface and ability to sort image results by file size (if I am looking for the highest quality version of an image) and upload date (if I am looking for the original version of an image).
